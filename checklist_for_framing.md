# Checklist for Framing

*These notes are just meant as suggestions for what you could do at an event to frame it. It is by no means complete, nor are you obliged to talk about everything listed here.*

1. Use the hand-sign to quiet down the room
- Welcome everyone to our event
- Briefly tell people what is going to happen in the next few minutes.
- Thank the host for sponsoring the event and give them room for a short pitch about their company
- Frame Software Craftsmanship
  1. Ask who's with us for the first time
  - Explain (or let someone explain) what Craftsmanship is about
- Mention our [values](https://github.com/swkBerlin/resources/blob/master/safe_environment.md) and tell people to approach the organizers (who wear a name tag with a üíù) in case they feel uncomfortable.
- Advertise the next events that are coming up (e.g. the next monthly meeting or a special event)
- **BONUS**: Get a discussion going about something passionate to you or craftspeople (e.g. diversity, professionalism, respect, ethics, you name it)
