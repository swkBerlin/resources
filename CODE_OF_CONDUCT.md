# Code of Conduct

We are dedicated to creating an event where everybody can learn, teach, share, network and have a good time.
We need your help to achieve that. We expect you to behave according to our Code of Conduct - both at the event and in all discussions around the event (online and offline).
If someone tells you that they were harmed by what you said or did, stand back, believe them and take a moment to reflect. Even if you find yourself not understanding their reasoning, your best reply to that is taking a deep breath and just saying "sorry". That's the baseline of mindfulness and empathy we'd like to see at the conference.

## Why do we have a CoC?

We are dedicated to creating an event where everybody can learn, teach, share, network and have a good time. This can only work when we are inclusive to the largest number of contributors and when we create an environment where everybody feels safe and welcome.

## CoC Violations

If you think someone has violated our code of conduct - even if you were not directly involved, like you just overheard a conversation - please:

- Let the person know that what they did is not appropriate and ask them to stop.
- Contact the organizers
- Possible actions we will take include:
- Give a warning
- Have a longer talk about our values
- Expel the perpetrator from the event
- Call the authorities

## Safe Environment

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack of any of those).
And so we invite all those who participate in this event and the community surrounding it to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone. With your help, this event can be a great experience for everyone!

- Treat everyone professionally - Everybody at the event is a professional in their field.
- Treat all attendees as equals.
- Ask before you teach.
- Do not explain things without being asked - the person you are talking to right now might know more or different things about the topic than you!
- Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.
- Give people the benefit of doubt.
- Ask questions before jumping to conclusions.
- Be respectful.
- Not all of us will agree with each other all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners.
- We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.
- Be aware of the effect your words may have on others.
- We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally.
- Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants.
- Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.
- Be careful with jokes. We do not tolerate any CoC violations, even if “it was just a joke”.
- Admit when you do not know something. Encourage others to admit when they do not know something - and never joke about it. We are all here to learn.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

- Harassment, and other exclusionary behavior.
- Deliberate intimidation and threats.
- Aggressive or sexualized language and content.
- Unwanted sexual advances.
- Insulting or putting down other participants.
- Personal or political attacks.
- Publishing or telling others that a participant belongs to a particular identity channel without asking for their consent first.
- Well-actuallies: Telling people what they “actually meant to say”.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Need Help?

If you need help, have any further questions or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff immediately.
