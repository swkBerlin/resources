# Roundtable: Lean Coffee

Join us for a [Lean Coffee](http://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/) - a roundtable to talk about new technologies, team dynamics, agile methodologies, software design considerations - you name it!

Bring your ideas and weâ€™ll take care of the rest!

[We strive to provide a safe environment for everyone.](https://github.com/swkBerlin/values/blob/master/safe_environment.md)

Craftsmanship values sharing knowledge. It is a great opportunity to network while learning from other companies' experiences.

Please be aware that we usually don't provide a full dinner unless explicitly stated. The hosts may provide some snacks and definitely non-alcoholic beverages.

## Schedule

18:45 - doors open  
19:15 - event starts  
21:30 - closing

We will, as usual, go to a pub nearby to continue our conversations over a beer or a soda.
