# Coding Kata

Software Craftsmanship is more than coding. Let's learn more about each other and start building a community of professionals to solve things that are bothering us. But it is also about practice and writing well-crafted software. Therefore we will practice TDD and work on a coding katas with constraints.

Please (if possible) bring your laptop and a working development environment with a **project with a failing test**. You can find some bootstrap projects [here](https://github.com/swkBerlin/kata-bootstraps).

[We strive to provide a safe environment for everyone.](https://github.com/swkBerlin/values/blob/master/safe_environment.md)
