# Coderetreat - Checklist for Hosts

This checklist outlines what we'd need from a venue hosting a coderetreat. It builds upon our [general information for location hosts](../general_information_for_location_hosts.md). Please contact us at [swkberlin-orga@googlegroups.com](mailto:swkberlin-orga@googlegroups.com?subject=Coderetreat%20Hosting) if you would like to host a coderetreat.

## About the event

A coderetreat is a full-day event starting at around **8AM** and ending at around **5PM**. In sessions of 45 minutes, pairs will work on a coding exercise, followed by a retrospective. Lunch and breakfast are free for the participants.

A coderetreat can have between 8 and 50 participants. This depends on the **room size** and the **number of available facilitators**.


## Room setup

- Spaced out table-isles for 2-4 pairs to work on  
It is important that facilitators can go around and conveniently join pairs and support them in their exercise
- Flipcharts and a projector
- Power outlets at the tables
- Spacious places to hold retrospectives at (e.g. outside, terrace, conference rooms, hallways)

## Required sponsoring

- A small healthy breakfast (e.g. coffee and bagles)
- A small healthy lunch (e.g. salad, wraps)
- Healthy snacks in-between (e.g. fruits)

## Schedule

The organizers will typically arrive by **8AM** and help set up the venue. If necessary, signs showing the way to the event venue should be put up as soon as possible.

By **8:30AM**, the first participants will arrive. One organizer will handle signing them in in order to refund their deposit and to handout nametags.

Lunch is served around **1PM**.

After a large retrospective at the end (usually between **4PM and 5PM**), the participants will help clean up the space. We're happy to leave with the location host and make sure the venue is clean.
